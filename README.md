### -*Bootstrap and Css*-

This planner webpage is designed so that with little effort you can layout the plans of your day and be able to refer back to and edit your plans and make notes and save your changes to the local storage so you dont lose any data !

### Learning every single day

I went into this project confident I knew alot about linking and applying jquery methods to javascript but I refered back to the documentation quite a few times. I struggled with the appending of the variables I had already scoped and only after some looking back I realized I had spelled the variable wrong when calling on it with the append at the bottom of the code.
